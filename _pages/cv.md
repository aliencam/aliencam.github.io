Education
======
* Ph.D in Materials Science, Arizona State University, 2020
  * Dissertation Title: "Synthesis, Characterization, and Optimization of Superconductor-Dielectric Interfaces"
* M.S. in Materials Science, Arizona State University, 2014
  * Thesis Title: "Analysis of Proximitized Molybdenum-Copper Superconducting Bilayers"
* B.S.E. in Materials Science & Engineering, Arizona State University, 2011

Work experience
======
* 2011-2020: PhD Research Assistant
  * Arizona State University
  * Supervisor: Professor Nathan Newman
  * Investigated physical causes of microwave loss at resonator interfaces by fabricating prototype devices, and identifying chemical, structural, and electrical properties of interface defects using characterization techniques such as DLTS, TOF-SIMS, and atomic resolution TEM. Developed low-microwave loss deposited dielectric films to enable new device architectures and products.
  * Developed deposition techniques for fabrication of integrated low-TLS loss high-ε dielectric thin-films with high TC superconductors by using buffer layer structures. 
  *	Designed methods for failure analysis and benchmarking prototype devices and commercial products through chemical, electrical, and structural characterization.

* 2011-2014: Masters Student Researcher
  * Arizona State University
  * supervisor: Professor Nathan Newman

* August 2010- May 2011: NASA Space Grant Intern
  * Arizona State University
  * Researched the effects of ion irradiation on Josephson Junctions and superconducting electronics using α-particle accelerator. Deposited film structures, performed irridiation, measured and simulated layer intermixing using RBS and SRIM/TRIM software.
