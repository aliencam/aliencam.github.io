Hello, I am Cameron Kopas, an experimental physicist and recent PhD graduate from Arizona State University. When I’m not in a basement lab, or talking about other peoples’ science on my [podcast](https://www.laserpodcast.com/), you’ll find me doing exploration, mapping, and conservation projects in caves, on long-distance bicycle or backpacking trips, fermenting whatever I can get my hands on, and finding new movies and bands to see. My adventure partner and fiancé is Sasha Poujlivaia, a computer programmer with little public web presence.  This site has a combination of my academic and public work, you can find: 
* My complete [CV](https://aliencam.github.io/cv/)
* A list of available [Publications](https://aliencam.github.io/publications/)
..* If you can't get access to any of the papers, get in touch and I can send them to you
* [Laboratory Resources](https://aliencam.github.io/resources/), including instrument interface programs, tutorial videos, and instrument procedures
* A [Portfolio](https://aliencam.github.io/portfolio/) of lab instruments and systems that I have managed. 

If you would like to contact me before I set up a contact page, please use Twitter, LinkedIn, or ResearchGate.
