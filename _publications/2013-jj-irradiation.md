This paper studies the effect that helium ion irridiation (alpha-particles) has on the layer intermixing and electrical performance of Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions. My role was to perform irridiation, and measure the extent of mixing using Rutherford backscttering spectroscopy (RBS), as well as simulate expected results using SRIM and TRIM.
