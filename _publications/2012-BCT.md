This paper establishes growth conditions for high-quality Ba(Cd1/3Ta2/3)O3 thin films using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). My role was to deposit some films, and perform chemical and structural analysis of film structures using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS).
