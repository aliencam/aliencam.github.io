This paper documents a new sequential co-evaporation method for fabrication of FeS2 (iron pyrite) thin films, and the substrate temperature dependence on the film properties. My contribution was to consult on design and construction of the deposition system, and to measure chemical and structural composition of films using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and precession diffraction.
