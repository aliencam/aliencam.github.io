Describing a technique to measure in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) losses of films, or specific superconducting resonators. Using this technique we are able to identify and quantify microwave losses from Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in Ba(Zn<sub>1/3</sub>Ta<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>, Co<sup>2+</sup> ions in Ba(Nb<sub>1/3</sub>Ta<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>, and losses from dangling bond states in thin-film deposited amorphous Silicon.
